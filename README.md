/Learning modern c++ and opengl

Things have changed in c++ and opengl. Previously I didnt have the experience to understand what I was doing. But now, it is a good time to start again!

I want the freedon to be able to freely work in low level frameworks.

This project is nothing special, i am getting the rust off and remembering the basics of both c++ and opengl

Depends on GLAD and GLFW3
